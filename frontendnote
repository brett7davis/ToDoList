make app: yarn create react-app [your-app-name]

public is where our static assets go, like our favicon. It also houses our project’s only HTML file. 
Because React is all-javascript, you only really need the HTML file to update the <head> stuff, like title and meta tags.

npm_modules == 3rd party code

src == application lives here

Deployment:
  1) yarn run build
    `build` is an NPM script provided by create-react-app.
    It bundles up your code into ready-to-deploy static files. 
    If you check the ‘build’ directory in your project, you’ll see what it generates.
    
  2) yarn global add surge -- installed globally so we can use its cli tool
  
  3) project path -- run "surge"
  
  4) in package.json, under scripts, add "deploy": "yarn run build && surge -p build -d your-domain.surge.sh"
